==========================================

Bug fixes:

  * Even more functions are exported (changed from manually generated
    to automatically generated NAMESPACE file; this has caused

Other changes:

  * More tests added Would like to use snake_case rather than
  * camelCase in function names, but this causes too much trouble to
  * change downstream so we accept dual names for some functions for now.
